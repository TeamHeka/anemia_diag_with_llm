Otherwise if the hemoglobin value is greaterthan 12 g/&#x27;dL but less than 13 g/&#x27;dL, ask for the gender of the patient.3) If the patient is female and their hemoglobin value is greater than 12 g/&#x27;dL, the diagnosis is No anemia, even if the hemoglobin value is not greater than 13 g/&#x27;dL.

Otherwise if the hemoglobin value is greaterthan 12 g/&#x27;dL but less than 13 g/&#x27;dL, ask for the gender of the patient.3) If the patient is female and their hemoglobin value is greater than 12 g/&#x27;dL, the diagnosis is No anemia, even if the hemoglobin value is not greater than 13 g/&#x27;dL.Otherwise ask for the mean corposcular volume.4) For the mean corposcular volume you can distinguish four cases (named a,b,c,d):case a) If the mean corpuscular volume results are unavailable, the diagnosis is Inconclusive diagnosis.case b) If the mean corpuscular volume is less than 80 fL, ask for the ferritin value.
